<p>Organizations make choices about word usage, spelling, punctuation, and use of acronyms (among other things) to make documents easily readable and professional. Sometimes these choices are governed by strict rules of grammar and punctuation. Other times, the choices are stylistic and a matter of editorial judgment.</p>   
                <p>Most organizations choose from one of several standard style books to guide writers and editors in making some of these editorial choices. These style books are also useful for looking up standard rules of grammar and punctuation and other information. The Urban Institute uses the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> (16th edition) and <em>Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary</em> (10th edition).</p>
              <p>The Urban style guide supplements these references and addresses points on which our style differs from Chicago and Merriam-Webster's. In some cases, the style guide indicates which of several options presented by Chicago or Merriam-Webster's is used in Urban publications.</p>
              <p>Urban style also incorporates elements of AP, Bluebook, and CBO style. The final section of this guide lists the online resources the editors consult regularly.</p>
