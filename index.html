                <h1>About This  Guide</h1>
                <p>Organizations make choices about word usage, spelling, punctuation, and use of acronyms (among other things) to make documents easily readable and professional. Sometimes these choices are governed by strict rules of grammar and punctuation. Other times, the choices are stylistic and a matter of editorial judgment.</p>   
                <p>Most organizations choose from one of several standard style books to guide writers and editors in making some of these editorial choices. These style books are also useful for looking up standard rules of grammar and punctuation and other information. The Urban Institute uses the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> (16th edition) and <em>Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary</em> (10th edition).</p>
              <p>The Urban style guide supplements these references and addresses points on which our style differs from Chicago and Merriam-Webster's. In some cases, the style guide indicates which of several options presented by Chicago or Merriam-Webster's is used in Urban publications.</p>
              <p>Urban style also incorporates elements of AP, Bluebook, and CBO style. The final page of this guide lists the online resources that the editors consult regularly.</p>

                <p>Our name appears in branded text (logos, decorative footers in documents, and so on), as Urban Institute.

UI is no longer considered acceptable shorthand because it is commonly used for other terms (e.g., unemployment insurance, user interface).  </p>

                <p>Use an acronym only if the term it stands for appears five or more times in the publication. Define acronyms in the highlights section or executive summary and in the main body of the text. Once an acronym has been defined, it can be used interchangeably with its definition to avoid excessive repetition or awkward constructions (e.g., an acronym as the first word in a sentence or a paragraph).</p>

                <h1>Formatting and Punctuation</h1>
                
								<h2>Colons</h2>
                <p>Colons are used only after a phrase that functions as a complete sentence, not merely to indicate the presence of a list (e.g., <em>Several vulnerable groups will be affected: infants, single mothers, and those with incomes below 200 percent of FPL</em>). [Incorrect: <em>The survey covers: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.</em>] </p>
               
							  <h2>Commas</h2>
               	<p>Commas are used between clauses separated by conjunctions unless the clauses are short or closely related.<br />
								Use commas around parenthetical elements or nonrestrictive clauses.<br />
								Serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma): Three or more items in a list should be separated by commas:<br />
								<em>decisionmakers, policymakers, and the general public.</em></p>

								<h2>Dashes</h2>
									<p>En dashes (&ndash;) are used mainly to connect number ranges: 1997&ndash;2001. En dashes should not be used if &ldquo;from&rdquo; precedes the first number <em>(from 2:00–4:00)</em>; use &ldquo;to&rdquo; instead <em>(from 2:00 to 4:00)</em>.<br /> 
									En dashes are also used when a prefix applies to both parts of a compound adjective <em>(post&ndash;welfare reform eligibility rules)</em> or when one part of a compound adjective is itself an open compound or proper noun <em>(Donald Trump&ndash;style rhetoric)</em>.</p> 
									
									<p>Em dashes (&mdash;) are used to indicate sudden breaks in thought: <em>I sent the draft to the funder last Friday&mdash;or was it Thursday?</em><br />
									Em dashes are also used to set off an explanation or expansion, in place of parentheses: <em>Four states&mdash;Alabama, Alaska, New Mexico, and West Virginia&mdash;had December unemployment rates above 6.0 percent.</em><br /> 
									
									Em dashes can also be used, sparingly, to indicate emphasis: <em>The $384 billion to support asset development in 2013 primarily benefited higher-income families&mdash;exacerbating wealth inequality and racial wealth disparities.</em> This usage is more appropriate for blog posts and website content than for research products.</p>

							<h2>Initials</h2>
								<p>Use a space between two initials: <em>T. S. Eliot</em></p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
								<p >Run short lists into text. If list items are simple, no lettering or numbering is necessary. If list items are complex, or if you plan to refer to items  by their place in the list, use numbers: <br />
								<span class="indent">(1), (2), (3), [not (a), (b), (c)].</span><br />
								If the list is long, set as excerpt.</p>
								<p>The punctuation and capitalization of lists depends on whether the list items are complete sentences and whether the list is introduced by a complete sentence.</p>
								<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> the list is introduced by a complete sentence, and each list item is a complete sentence.</p>
								<p><em>These and other findings informed a set of principles that guided task force deliberations:<br />
										<ul>
										<li>Sentencing decisions and correctional interventions should be individualized.</li>
										<li>Correctional policy should improve public safety.</li>
										<li>Incarceration, with its attendant costs to both those in prison and taxpayers, should be employed judiciously.</li>
										<li>Data and research should guide practice.</li>
										<li>Reforms should both address prison growth and improve public safety outcomes.</li>
										</ul></em></p>
								<p>In this example, the list items start with a capital letter and end with a period. The introductory sentence ends with a colon, but it could also end with a period.</p>
								<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> the list is introduced by an incomplete sentence, and each list item is a complete sentence.</p>
								<p><em>Between 1985 and 2014,
										<ul>
										<li>convictions in US courts nearly doubled from 40,924 to 76,835, and</li>
										<li>the probability of receiving a term of incarceration at sentencing increased dramatically from 50 percent to 90 percent.</li>
										</ul></em></p>
								<p>In this example, the list items are finishing the sentence that starts with &ldquo;Between 1985 and 2014,&rdquo; and are capitalized and punctuated accordingly. If the list items have internal punctuation&mdash;for example, if the first bullet were &ldquo;convictions nearly doubled from 40,924 to 76,835, an increase of X percent&rdquo;&mdash;then every list item except the last would end with a semicolon instead of a comma.</p>
								<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> the list is introduced by a complete sentence, and each list item is an incomplete sentence. Here, list items are lowercased and have no punctuation at the end.</p>
								<p><em>Your application must include the following documents:
										<ul>
										<li>a full résumé</li>
										<li>three letters of recommendation</li>
										<li>all your diplomas, from high school to graduate school</li>
										</ul></em></p>
								<p>To make punctuation and capitalization of lists consistent throughout a document, write all lists using the same grammatical structure.</p>

								<h2>Common Nouns</h2>
								
               	 	<p>Capitalize common nouns such as party, river, street, and west when they are an integral part of the full name for a place or thing, even in plural uses.<br />
                <span class="indent">Democratic Party; Mississippi River; West Texas</span><br />
                <span class="indent">Democratic and Republican Parties; Main and State Streets</span></p>   
                <!---Commenting this out pending DISC recommendations---
								
								<h2>Ethnic, Socioeconomic, and Other Groups</h2>
								
                	<p>Capitalize the proper names of nationalities, peoples, races, and tribes:<br />
               		Caucasian, Cherokee, Chinese, Jewish, Hispanic<br />
               		Use lowercase for color:<br />
               		black (noun or adjective), white (noun or adjective)<br />
                	List ethnicity first, then race<br />
               		non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white<br />
                	Leave compound nationalities open (unhyphenated) as nouns and adjectives:<br />
                	African Americans, African American men, Asian American, Italian American<br />
                	but Asian-Pacific American (because the term encompasses two groups)</p>
                	<p>Generations<br />
                	baby boomers, generation X (or Y), millennials</p>--->
                
								<h2>Regions and Places</h2>
								
                	<p>Terms that denote regions of the world or of a particular country are often capitalized, as are a few of the adjectives and nouns derived from such terms.<br />
               	 	<span class="indent">the Eastern Seaboard, East Coast; east, eastern, eastward (directions)</span><br />
					<span class="indent">the Great Plains</span><br />
					<span class="indent">the Midwest, midwestern, a midwesterner</span><br />
					<span class="indent">the North, northern, a northerner</span></p>
    			<h2>Cases and Court Decisions</h2>
    				<p>Set case names, including the v., roman in notes (short forms in subsequent citations are italicized). Case names mentioned in running text are italicized. <br />
    				<span class="indent">The Supreme Court announced its decision in the <em>King v. Burwell</em> case in June 2015.</span><br />
    				<span class="indent">Less than a day after hearing oral arguments, the Supreme Court issues its decision in <em>Bush v. Gore.</em></span><br />

                        </ol>
                     </p>
    
    			<h2>Names of Federal Departments and Agencies</h2>
    
    				<p>Use the full name, including the US, on first usage:<br />
    				<span class="indent"><em>US Department of Agriculture/Commerce/Justice</em></span><br />
    				Preferred shorthand are the acronyms, which can be introduced in parentheses at the end of the full name:<br />
    				<span class="indent"><em>US Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Department of Transportation (DOT)</em></span><br />
    				Avoid inside-the-Beltway shorthands like &ldquo;State,&rdquo; &ldquo;Commerce,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Labor,&rdquo; which could be read as concepts rather than names. Exceptions to this rule are Treasury, which can't be shortened to DOT, and Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, which are more easily recognizable as names.</p>
                    
				<h2>Formal Titles</h2>

					<p>Capitalize formal titles when used immediately before a name, but not after:<br />
					<!--applying a style to a span for text longer than a line is not indenting all lines of text, only the first-->
					<span class="indent">President Sarah Rosen Wartell; Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, is a public policy </span> <br />
					<span class="indent">executive and housing markets expert.</span><br /> 
					<span class="indent">Senator Orrin Hatch; Senator Hatch; Orrin Hatch, the senior senator from Utah.</span></p>
					<p>Capitalize formal titles when not run into text. This may be when they are used alone, such as next to an image, or in event agendas and invitations when listing panelists:<br />
                    
                        <ul style="text-align:left; margin-top: -25px; font-size:18px; font-family: Lato,'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; margin-left: 60px">

                        </ul></p>

				<h2>Other Addresses</h2>

						<p>Washington, DC; use postal state abbreviations (MD, VA) except in formal addresses. [See <em>Chicago Manual of Style 14.17.</em>]</p>

            <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
                <h1>Numbers</h1>
                <h2>Numerals versus Words</h2>
                <p><em>Chicago</em> has more than 50 rules on this topic, and it's difficult to know which rule takes precedence when. Urban editors follow these general rules.</p>
				<ul>
                <li>Spell out zero through nine in nontechnical contexts; use numerals for all other numbers up to 1 million.</li>
                <li>Use numbers for ages and percentages (even zero through nine).</li> 
				<li>Spell out larger numbers when they are used in the approximate sense: <em>About a hundred soldiers were killed.</em> Use numerals for precise large numbers: <em>The sample included 30,412 men and 30,412 women.</em></li>
                <li>Spell out any number when it is the first word in a sentence: <em>Twenty-three people refused to answer.</em></li>
                <li>Treat similar numbers similarly. Numbers in the same category should be treated alike within the same context: <em>5 boys and 16 girls in three states.</em> &ldquo;Within the same context&rdquo; usually means in the same paragraph.</li></ul>
				<p>The rest of this section lists examples for particular kinds of numbers.</p>
                <h2>Age</h2>
                <p>children ages 2 to/through 6, 9 to/through 15 (not aged 2–6), between the ages of 9 and 15<br /> 
				24 years old, 11 months old, a 34-year-old woman, a 5-year-old<br />
				Try to avoid such constructions as &ldquo;age 0–5&rdquo;; use &ldquo;from birth to age 5&rdquo; instead.<br />
				More general terms (&ldquo;in his thirties&rdquo;) are allowed, but consider context (e.g., blog post or web feature versus scholarly report).</p>
                
<h2>Dates</h2>
<p>1994&ndash;95<br />
1990s (use an "s" without an apostrophe to indicate spans of decades or centuries), the sixties<br />
October 6, 1993; October 1993; April 17 (not April 17th)<br />
FY 1995, FY 1997&ndash;99, FY 1999&ndash;2001<br />
20th century<br />
shorthand for important events: 9/11</p>

<h2>Decimals</h2>
<p>Simple fractions are spelled out and hyphenated (see Fractions below). Large or complex fractions are expressed as decimal fractions.<br />
<span class="indent">two-thirds</span><br />
<span class="indent">0.79</span><br />
<span class="indent">0.22</span></p>
<p>Always place a zero before the decimal to improve readability. This is particularly important if numbers greater than 1.00 appear in the same context.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 60px">The federal interest rate increased from 0.88 percent to 1.12 percent.</span></p>
<p>This is also true of scientific values, even when quantities can only logically equal 1.00 or less, such as in probabilities, correlation coefficients, and so on.<br />
<span class="indent">A mean of 0.83</span><br />
<span class="indent">A ratio of 0.85</span><br />
<span class="indent"><em>p</em> &lt; 0.05</span><br />
<span class="indent"><em>R</em> = 0.10</span></p>
<p>A zero is customarily omitted in special circumstances where it would not be logical, such as firearm calibers.<br />
<span class="indent">&ldquo;The suspect is armed with a .38 pistol.&rdquo;</span></p>

<h2>Fractions</h2>
<p>Hyphenate as both adjective and noun:<br />
<span class="indent">a two-thirds majority; two-thirds of those present.</span></p>
<p>One-quarter is generally preferred to one-fourth, but treat similar fractions similarly:<br />
<span class="indent">One-fourth of students and one-fifth of teachers in County X are male.</span></p>
<h2>Grades</h2>
<p>Spell out one through nine, but treat low and high numbers similarly:<br />
<span class="indent">grades one through five; grades 9&ndash;12; grades 1&ndash;12</span></p>
<p>The same rule applies to ordinals:<br />
<span class="indent">first grade, 10th grade, from 8th to 12th grade</span></p>
<h2>Large Numbers</h2>
<p>2,000 (use comma)<br />
5 million (not 5,000,000)<br />
5 billion (not 5,000,000,000)</p>

<h2>Monetary Amounts</h2>
<p>$10 [not 10 dollars]<br />
$5 million [not 5 million dollars]<br />
Currency with dates and countries: $(2012)45,000; US$45,000; US$(2012)45,000</p>

<h2>Percent and Percentage</h2>
<p>Percent is one word.<br />
As an adverb (meaning &ldquo;of one hundred&rdquo;), <em>percent</em> cannot be the subject of a sentence. <em>Percentage</em> is a noun. (To avoid repetition, try &ldquo;share&rdquo; or &ldquo;rate&rdquo; instead.)<br />
9 percent (spell out &ldquo;percent,&rdquo; even in parentheses; use numeral before the word &ldquo;percent&rdquo;)<br />
15 to 20 percent (in text) [not <em>15 percent to 20 percent</em>]<br />
Within a table, % can stand for either <em>percent</em> or <em>percentage</em></p>

<h2>Ranges</h2>
<p>For ranges in tables and figures, be sure that the numbers given cover all possibilities within the range and that none of the ranges overlap.<br />
When displaying these ranges, there is no need to repeat the symbols:<br />
<span class="indent">5&ndash;10%</span><br />
<span class="indent">$6&ndash;8 million</span></p>
<p>Within text, it is not always necessary to repeat &ldquo;million&rdquo; for ranges, but consider the context. For something like, &ldquo;the program will cost $5 to $8 million,&rdquo; repeating the million is probably not necessary if the program  could not possibly cost just $5. However, if the text has been jumping in ranges, from hundreds to thousands to millions, then it is probably best to repeat the &ldquo;million.&rdquo;</p>

            <h1>Quotations</h1>
            	<h2>Permissible Changes to Quotations</h2>
                	<p>Minor punctuation and capitalization changes are generally allowed to make a quotation fit into the syntax of the surrounding text. These changes include capitalizing (or lowercasing) the first letter of the quote and changing double quotation marks to single (or vice versa).<br />
                    An ellipsis may be used at the beginning or end of a quotation to indicate that the person being quoted hesitates before speaking or does not complete his or her thought. It should not be used merely to indicate that other words precede and follow the quotation in its original context.</p>
                    
                <h2>Block Quotations/Excerpts</h2>
                	<p>Set off material of a hundred words or more<br />
                    If italics have been added, specify; [Jones 1996, emphasis added].<br />
                    If paragraphs occur within a continuous block, the first paragraph should have no indent, but subsequent paragraphs should be marked by indents rather than extra leading<br />
										Per Chicago 10.28: &ldquo;Material set off from the text as a block quotation is not enclosed in quotation marks. When a quotation that is run into the text in the typescript is converted to a block quotation, the quotation marks enclosing it are dropped, and interior quotation marks are changed accordingly.&rdquo;<br />
										Do not use initial ellipses.<br />
										Use brackets to indicate missing or illegible words or to clarify an ambiguity. In the latter case, use the bracketed text instead of, not in addition to, the ambiguous word(s): <em>[the nurse] said;</em> not <em>she [the nurse] said</em></p>

            <h1>Documentation</h1>
						<p>The Urban Institute uses parenthetical author-date citations and a corresponding reference list. Each entry in the reference list should be mentioned in the text, and all works cited in the text should appear in the reference list. Works not cited in the text may appear in a list of additional readings, but they should not be included in the formal reference list.</p>
						<h2>Notes versus Reference Lists: Which Sources Go Where?</h2>
						<p>Notes: blog posts, legal citations, magazine articles (print or online), newspaper articles (print or online), personal communications (e-mails, interviews, etc.), press releases, web pages and other website content, and other informally published work (i.e., work without an easily identifiable author, publication date, city of publication, or publisher).<br />
Reference lists: books, chapters in books, dissertations/theses, journal articles, papers or presentations from meetings, pdfs posted on websites, research briefs and papers, testimonies, and working papers.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> In the interest of shorter reference lists, URLs for pdfs posted on websites may be embedded under the publication title in reference lists.</p>

<h2>Author-Date Citations and Reference Lists</h2>
<p>The primary reference guide for Urban Institute publications is the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition (2010), figure 15.1, with some variations.</p>

<h3>Author-Date Citation in the Text</h3>

<ul>
<li>References are cited in the text by the author-date style, with no comma between author and date: (Buckley and Mayo 1987).</li>

<li>For references with four or more authors, use the name of the first author and then et al. However, if two references would shorten to the same form by using et al. (e.g., Haring, Bricker, White, and Jackson 1980 and Haring, Liberty, White, and Bricker 1980 would both become Haring et al. 1980), use as many authors’ names as necessary to make citation clear, followed by et al. (e.g., the above would be, respectively, Haring, Bricker, et al. 1980 and Haring, Liberty, et al. 1980). The reference list should provide all authors’ names.</li>

<li>All references cited in the text should agree with the information in the reference list. Check to make sure there are no spelling, date, or pagination inconsistencies.</li>

<li>Government agencies, organizations, or corporations as authors: For the sake of shorter parenthetical citations, an abbreviation may be used as the author in place of the full organization name (e.g., NFHA 2012). In such cases, the reference entry is alphabetized under that abbreviation, not the spelled-out name: NFHA (National Fair Housing Alliance). 2012. </li>

<li>If there is no author, use the first few words of the entry as it appears in the reference list; usually this logical unit is a title (e.g., “Development of the Housing Sector in Hungary” 1990; or Economic Times 1990).</li>

<li>When more than one reference is cited in the text parenthetically, arrange the citations in the order corresponding to that in the reference list (i.e., alphabetically by surname, chronologically within references by one author, earliest work first).</li>

<li>For citations in which the same senior author appears in various works as a solo author and a coauthor, the single-author cites come first chronologically, earliest work first, followed by multiple-author cites. The two- and three-author cites should be arranged alphabetically following the first author in each cite, with each cite separated by a semicolon (e.g., Liberty 1987, 1990; Liberty and Haring 1989; Liberty, Haring, and White 1990; Liberty, White, and Bricker 1988).</li>

<li>For works by the same author or authors published in the same year, use a, b, c, etc., immediately after the year in the author-date citation to distinguish the references (e.g., Struyk and Ravicz 1992a).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reference Lists</h3>

<p>Reference lists should be arranged according to the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alphabetize by surname of senior author.</li>
<li>For works by the same author, follow these criteria:<ol type="a"><li style="font-size: 1em">Date of publication, with earlier work placed first</li>
<li style="font-size: 1em">Surname of second author (or third, if second authors are the same, etc.).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use three em dashes followed by a period (&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.) in place of author(s) in reference list to indicate successive cites by the same author(s). Do not use the rule if only some authors are repeated or if new authors are added to the repeated ones.</li>
<li>Provide first and last names for <em>all</em> authors and editors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Reference Styles for non-Urban Publications</h2>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p class="introline">A standard reference entry for a book should contain the following information:</p>

<p class="hangingindent">Author, First, Second Author, and Third Author. Year of Publication. <em>Book Title Italicized</em>. City of Publication, STATE (two-letter) or COUNTRY (three-letter) abbreviation: Publisher.</p>

<p>If the city of publication is a major US city (Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Seattle) or a major international city or capital (London, Paris, Tokyo, etc., as well as Sydney and Geneva), the state or country abbreviation may be omitted.
