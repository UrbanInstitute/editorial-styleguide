                <h1>About This  Guide</h1>
                <h2>What is style?</h2>
                <p>Organizations make choices about word usage, spelling, punctuation, and use of acronyms (among other things) to make documents easily readable and professional. Sometimes these choices are governed by strict rules of grammar and punctuation. Other times, the choices are stylistic and a matter of editorial judgment.</p>   
                <h2>How are Urban style decisions made?</h2>
                <p>Most organizations choose from one of several standard stylebooks to guide writers and editors in making some of these editorial choices. These stylebooks are also useful for looking up standard rules of grammar and punctuation and other information. The Urban Institute uses the Chicago Manual of Style (16th edition) and Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (10th edition).</p>
              <p>The Urban style guide supplements these references and addresses points on which our style differs from Chicago and Merriam-Webster. In some cases, the style guide indicates which of several options presented by Chicago or Merriam-Webster is used in Urban publications.</p>
              <p>Urban style also incorporates elements of AP, Blue Book, and CBO style. The final page of this guide lists the online resources that the editors consult regularly.</p>

                <h1>Alphabetical Guide to Spelling and Distinctive Treatment of Words</h1>
                <p>The main content well on the Urban website is 685px wide, which translates to approximately 9.75” wide in Excel. Because Excel’s chart title and subtitle fields are limiting in terms of formatting, we use a regular text box for all the text at the top of the graphic, as well as the source and notes text at the bottom. We also include an Urban tag in the lower-right corner of the figure so that when media members copy-paste our charts into their stories, Urban’s brand is on them.</p>
                <p>This tagline is built from standard text using Lato Regular with 1pt of expanded character spacing. Urban is colored blue—#1696d2 or rgb(22,150,210)—and Institute is black. The text is in uppercase and should be 9pt for web, 7pt for print.</p>

                <h1>Frequently Used Acronyms and Abbreviations</h1>
                <p>Use an acronym only if the term it stands for appears five or more times in the publication. Define acronyms in the highlights section or executive summary and in the main body of the text. Once an acronym has been defined, it can be used interchangeably with its definition to avoid excessive repetition or awkward constructions (e.g., an acronym as the first word in a sentence or a paragraph).<br />

                <h1>Formatting and Punctuation</h1>
                <h2>Colons</h2>
                <p>Colons should be used only after a phrase that functions as a complete sentence, not merely to indicate the presence of a list (e.g., <em>Several vulnerable groups will be affected: infants, single mothers, and those with incomes below 200 percent of FPL</em>). [Incorrect: <em>The survey covers: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.</em>] </p>
                <h2>Commas</h2>
               <p>Commas should be used between clauses separated by conjunctions unless the clauses are short or closely related.<br />
Use commas around parenthetical elements or nonrestrictive clauses.<br />
Serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma): Three or more items in a list should be separated by commas:<br />
decisionmakers, policymakers, and the general public.</p>
<h2>Dashes</h2>
<p>En dashes (–) are used mainly to connect number ranges: 1997–2001. En dashes should not be used if “from” precedes the first number (from 2:00–4:00); use: “to” instead (from 2:00 to 4:00).<br /> 
En dashes are also used when a prefix applies to both parts of a compound adjective (post–welfare reform eligibility rules) or when one part of a compound adjective is itself an open compound (Donald Trump–style rhetoric).</p> 

<p>Em dashes (—) are used to indicate sudden breaks in thought: I sent the draft to the funder last Friday—or was it Thursday?<br />
Em dashes are also used to set off an explanation or expansion, in place of parentheses: Four states—Alabama, Alaska, New Mexico, and West Virginia—had December unemployment rates above 6.0 percent.<br /> 

Em dashes can also be used, sparingly, to indicate emphasis: The $384 billion to support asset development in 2013 primarily benefited higher-income families—exacerbating wealth inequality and racial wealth disparities. This usage is more appropriate for blog posts and website content than for research products.</p>
<h2>Initials</h2>
<p>Use a space between two initials:<br />
T. S. Eliot</p>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Run lists into text with numbers: <br />
(1), (2), (3), [not (a), (b), (c)].<br />
If the list is long, set as excerpt.</p>
<p>The punctuation and capitalization of lists varies based on whether the list items are complete sentences and whether the list is introduced by a complete sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> the list is introduced by a complete sentence, and each list item is a complete sentence.</p>
<p><em>These and other findings informed a set of principles that guided task force deliberations:<br />
<ul>
<li>Sentencing decisions and correctional interventions should be individualized.</li>
<li>Correctional policy should improve public safety.</li>
<li>Incarceration, with its attendant costs to both those in prison and taxpayers, should be employed judiciously.</li>
<li>Data and research should guide practice.</li>
<li>Reforms should both address prison growth and improve public safety outcomes.</li>
</ul></em></p>
<p>Here, the list items start with a capital letter and end with a period. The introductory sentence ends with a colon, but it could also end with a period.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> the list is introduced by an incomplete sentence, and each list item is a complete sentence.</p>
<p><em>Between 1985 and 2014,
<ul>
<li>convictions in US courts nearly doubled from 40,924 to 76,835, and</li>
<li>the probability of receiving a term of incarceration at sentencing increased dramatically from 50 percent to 90 percent.</li>
</ul></em></p>
<p>Here, the list items are finishing the sentence that starts with “Between 1985 and 2014,” and are capitalized and punctuated accordingly. If the list items have internal punctuation—for example, if the first bullet were “convictions nearly doubled from 40,924 to 76,835, an increase of X percent”—then every list item except the last would end with a semicolon instead of a comma.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> the list is introduced by a complete sentence, and each list item is an incomplete sentence. Here, list items are lowercased and have no punctuation at the end.</p>
<p><em>Your application must include the following documents:
<ul>
<li>a full résumé</li>
<li>three letters of recommendation</li>
<li>all your diplomas, from high school to graduate school</li>
</ul></em></p>
<p>If an author or editor wants to use one punctuation and capitalization standard for lists, then he or she must ensure that all lists follow the same grammatical structure.</p>

<!-- Names and Terms Section -->

                <h1>Names and Terms</h1>
                <h2>Common Nouns</h2>
               	 	<p>Capitalize common nouns such as party, river, street, and west when they are an integral part of the full name for a place or thing, even in plural uses.<br />
                Democratic Party; Mississippi River; West Texas<br />
                Democratic and Republican Parties; Main and State Streets</p>   
                <h2>Ethnic, Socioeconomic, and Other Groups</h2>
                	<p>Capitalize the proper names of nationalities, peoples, races, and tribes:<br />
               		Caucasian, Cherokee, Chinese, Jewish, Hispanic<br />
               		Use lowercase for color:<br />
               		black (noun or adjective), white (noun or adjective)<br />
                	List ethnicity first, then race<br />
               		non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white<br />
                	Leave compound nationalities open (unhyphenated) as nouns and adjectives:<br />
                	African Americans, African American men, Asian American, Italian American<br />
                	but Asian-Pacific American (because the term encompasses two groups)</p>
                	<p>Generations<br />
                	baby boomers, generation X (or Y), millennials</p>
                <h2>Regions and Places</h2>
                	<p>Terms that denote regions of the world or of a particular country are often capitalized, as are a few of the adjectives and nouns derived from such terms.<br />
               	 	the Eastern Seaboard, East Coast; east, eastern, eastward (directions)
					the Great Plains<br />
					the Midwest, midwestern, a midwesterner<br />
					the North, northern, a northerner</p>
    			<h2>Cases and Court Decisions</h2>
    				<p>Set case names, including the v., roman in notes (short forms in subsequent citations are italicized). Case names mentioned in running text are italicized. <br />
    				The Supreme Court announced the decision in the <em>King v. Burwell</em> case in 	June of 2015.<br />
    				Less than a day after hearing oral arguments, the Supreme Court issues its decision in <em>Bush v. Gore.</em><br />
                    
                        <ol style="text-align:left">
                        <li>King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. __ (2015).</li>
                        <li>Bush v. Gore 531 U.S. 98 (2000).</li>
                        <li>McClutchen v. US Department of Health and Human Services, 30 F.3d 183 (1994).</li>
                        <li><em>Bush,</em> 531 U.S. at 99.</li>
                        <li><em>McClutchen,</em> 30 F. 3d at 183–84.</li>
                        </ol>
                     </p>
    
    			<h2>Names of Federal Departments and Agencies</h2>
    
    				<p>Use the full name, including the US, on first usage:<br />
    				US Department of Agriculture/Commerce/Justice<br />
    				Preferred shorthand are the acronyms which can be introduced in parentheses at the end of the full name:<br />
    				US Department of Agriculture (USDA), US Department of Transportation (DOT)<br />
    				Avoid inside-the-Beltway shorthands like "State," "Commerce," and "Labor," which could be read as concepts rather than names. Exceptions to this rule are Treasury, which can't be shortened to DOT, and Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, which are more easily recognizable as names.</p>
                    
				<h2>Formal Titles</h2>

					<p>Capitalize formal titles when used immediately before a name, but not after:<br />
					President Sarah Rosen Wartell; Sarah Rosen Wartell, president of the Urban Institute, is a public policy executive and housing markets expert.<br /> 
					Senator Orrin Hatch; Senator Hatch; Orrin Hatch, the senior senator from Utah.</p>
					<p>Capitalize formal titles when not run into text. This may be when they are used alone, such as next to an image, or in event agendas and invitations when listing panelists:<br />
                    
                        <ul>
