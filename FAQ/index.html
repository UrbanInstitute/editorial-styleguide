               <h1>Frequently Asked Style Questions</h1>
                <p>Organizations make choices about word usage, spelling, punctuation, and use of acronyms (among other things) to make documents easily readable and professional. Sometimes these choices are governed by strict rules of grammar and punctuation. Other times, the choices are stylistic and a matter of editorial judgment.</p>   
                <p>Most organizations choose from one of several standard style books to guide writers and editors in making some of these editorial choices. These style books are also useful for looking up standard rules of grammar and punctuation and other information. The Urban Institute uses the <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.com"><em>Chicago Manual of Style</em></a> (16th edition) and <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com"><em>Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary</em></a> (10th edition).</p>
              <p>The Urban style guide supplements these references and addresses points on which our style differs from Chicago and Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s. In some cases, the style guide indicates which of several options presented by Chicago or Merriam-Webster's is used in Urban publications.</p>
              <p>Urban style also incorporates elements of AP, Bluebook, and CBO style. The final section of this guide <a href="../index.html#resources">lists</a> the online resources the editors consult regularly.</p>

								</a></div><p><strong>Why do you style a word or phrase one way in this sentence, but another way in another sentence? Isn&rsquo;t that inconsistent?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>This question takes many forms, but often it involves discrepancies in whether a phrase is hyphenated or left open,  a number is expressed through words or a numeral, or different forms of a word are capitalized. The short answer is that it all depends on context, and consistency doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean always treating a word or phrase exactly the same in all contexts.</p>

<p>For example, some phrases are hyphenated when they appear before a noun, acting as a unit modifier, but  left open when appearing after a noun or on their own (<em>She is a part-time worker; she works part time</em>). Another common example occurs with number: Urban style in most instances is to spell out zero through nine and use numerals for 10 or greater. But if just one of several numbers in proximity takes a numeral, all similar numbers in that context should take a numeral (<em>We raised 4 goats, 13 chickens, and 9 pigs</em>). Although <em>four</em> and <em>nine</em> would be spelled out in most other instances in a document, they are written numerically there for consistency within the immediate context.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever unsure about whether a style choice is consistent, just ask! We&rsquo;d be happy to explain the rule and our reasoning or correct the error.</p>

								</a></div><p style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Are these changes unbreakable rules, or just some suggestions that I can choose not to follow?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Any rule can and should be broken if following it would hinder or confuse the reader, but these aren&rsquo;t just suggestions, either. Organizations use editorial standards to ensure consistency and quality across products, and those standards need to be enforced if they&rsquo;re to be useful. Moreover, these choices are a means to an end: consistency and thoughtfulness in what may seem like inconsequential details bolsters your credibility as an author and elevates Urban&rsquo; reputation.</p>
<p>The majority of our style rules are prescribed explicitly by the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> or <em>Merriam Webster&rsquo;s</em>; for other rules, we&rsquo;ve chosen one way of doing something from among several equally valid or grammatical options.

								</a></div><p style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Does the Department of Editorial Services and Publications ever change Urban style rules?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes. We want our rules to reflect best practices for clarity and efficacy in writing and the needs of our authors, and we will glady change them in pursuit of that. However, many factors need to be considered for a change to be made, and that generally means that one publication&rsquo;s need or one author&rsquo;s preference aren&rsquo;t enough for an Institute-wide shift in style. We welcome feedback on what style rules contradict your experience with a subject or hinder a reader&rsquo;s understanding. Once we have an evidence base showing that a rule isn&rsquo;t meeting authors&rsquo; needs, we&rsquo;ll address it.</p></div>

								</a></div><p style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>What do you do if my funder&rsquo;s style differs from Urban&rsquo;s?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p> If your funder is publishing the products or if they insist on using their style and we&rsquo;ve agreed to that in the contract, send us the funder's guidance, and we&rsquo;ll do our best to incorporate it into your products.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, Urban products should follow Urban style and uphold the Urban brand. However, we don&rsquo;t want to jeopardize your relationships with your funders&mdash;there&rsquo;s some nuance to the intersection of ownership, partnership, branding, and style, and often it makes sense or simply is necessary to deviate from our standard practices to fulfill contractual obligations or improve a product.</p>
<p>If we need to follow a funder&rsquo;s style, let us know as early as possible. We&rsquo;ll try to remember to use it, but it&rsquo;s the author&rsquo;s responsibility to remind us and to forward any style updates from the funder.</p></div>
  
  <button class="accordion"><div class="btncontainer"><a class="btn btn-circle">
								<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color: black"></i>
								</a></div><p><strong>My center has acronyms, terms, and names that come up a lot in our publications. Can we add them to the style guide?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Yes, and we have a couple of options for doing so. For material relevant to several centers or Urban at large, we can add it to the main style guide. For material that tends to appear in one center&rsquo;s or initiative&rsquo;s publications, we have center-specific style guide appendices. There, we can record style choices concerning fine-grain or esoteric words and phrases. We also maintain funder style guides, allowing us to keep track of how different funders prefer we style different pieces of text.</p>
<p>All of our style sources cascade downward in specificity. At the highest and broadest level, sources like the <em>Chicago Manual</em> and the Urban style guide prescribe sweeping rules about grammar, punctuation, and usage. Center appendices and funder style guides address specific terms of industry, programs, and technical phrases. At the lowest and finest level are the style sheets we create for almost all individual editorial projects, where we can track how we abbreviate, hyphenate, capitalize, and spell.</p></div>

								</a></div><p style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Why does editing take so long?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
		<p>To understand why our work takes the time that it does, it&rsquo;s useful to know what it entails&mdash;it requires a lot more than simply reading through the document. <a href="https://urbanorg.box.com/s/nuv8esve7gojbo5jsbd1hy380o93ugbu">This document</a> provides a rough overview of three levels of editing and the types of changes usually made at each level.</p>
		<p>Most editorial work occurs at a rate of between three and eight manuscript pages per hour (a manuscript page is measured as 250 words). Adding in editing and formatting for figures and tables (5&ndash;25 minutes each, depending on complexity) and citation work can quickly add hours to the estimate. These numbers may seem high, and to some extent they are&mdash;it&rsquo;s better to estimate based on the worst case scenario (a dense, complex text with many inconsistencies and errors to fix) and potentially end up returning an assignment early and under budget.</p>
		<p>One final element to consider is your editor&rsquo;s overall workload. Although the initial edit of a product may require only, say, eight hours, the editor likely doesn&rsquo;t have the next eight hours completely free for your project&mdash;he or she may need a few days or even a week to begin work on your project and is likely working through several projects at once.</p> 
		<p>The best thing you can do for your project is come to us as early as possible. We can work with any budget and time constraints you have to figure out the best plan for your publication, and if necessary we can block off time to dedicate to your project and work through it quickly.</p>
</div>
		<button class="accordion"><div class="btncontainer"><a class="btn btn-circle" style="margin-top: -5px; margin-bottom: 10px">
								<i class="fa fa-angle-right" style="color: black"></i>
								</a></div><p style="padding-top: 5px;"><strong>Why did my estimate change after I sent you the file?</strong></p></button>
<div class="panel">
<p>We try our best to provide accurate estimates from the start, but that&rsquo;s just what they are: estimates. Most often, estimates change when a publication we receive is longer than was reported (and remember, as mentioned in the previous question, we may measure pages differently than you do). Other times, the publication may be more complex than anticipated: dense, complicated text, many tables and figures, numerous references and notes, or appendices could all increase our work estimate once we receive the file. </p>
<p>These estimate increases can be avoided by providing us clear, accurate information as early as possible. Word counts give us a better sense of length than page counts, and even rough estimates from you of the number of tables, figures, citations, and appendices can help us pad our hours so that even if they do change, it won&rsquo;t be by too much.</p>
